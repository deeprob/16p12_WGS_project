Codebase for the manuscript titled *"Distinct variant classes differentially contribute to specific phenotypes of neurodevelopmentaldisorders"*

## Repository structure
The codebase is divided into multiple directories based on the order of results that appear in the manuscript except the preprocess directory. Further details about each directory is included in independent README.md files within the directory. 

A brief description of each directory is given below:

**0_preprocess**: This directory holds all the raw data pre-processing scripts for this project. The pre-processed data is shared amongst all the other directories.

**1_secondary_variants_on_clinical_outcomes**: This directory holds the analysis scripts for Result 1 (*Differential effects of secondary variants towards clinical outcomes*) in the manuscript.   

**2_secondary_variants_modulate_pheno_domains**: This directory holds the analysis scripts for Result 2 (*Classes of secondary variants jointly modulate specific developmental domains*) in the manuscript.   

**3_secondary_variants_ltm_model**: This directory holds the analysis scripts for Result 3 (*Patterns of secondary variants conform to an inheritance-based liability threshold model*) in the manuscript.   

**4_secondary_variants_synergy**: This directory holds the analysis scripts for Result 4 (*Secondary variants synergistically modify clinical phenotypes of deletion carriers*) in the manuscript.   

**5_secondary_variants_other_cohort**: This directory holds the analysis scripts for Result 5 (*Contributions of secondary variants to disease in other primary variant carriers*) in the manuscript.
