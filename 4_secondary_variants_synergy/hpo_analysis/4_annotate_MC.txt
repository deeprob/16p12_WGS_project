To get the HPO terms associated with the MC terms, MC terms were manually entered into the HPO website (hpo.jax.org)
The relevant HPO ID for each term was manually added to an Excel sheet.

This was done for both the child Master Checklist and the adult Master Checklist. Terms for both MCs were compiled into the same file.
The output files is: Analysis_files/MC_HPO_terms.xlsx
