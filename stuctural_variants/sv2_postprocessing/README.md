# SV2 post-processing

Jupyter notebooks for postprocessing SV2 output.

### merge_sv2_vcfs.ipynb

Merges VCFs output by SV2. Removes calls that aren't DUPs or DELs, and that aren't FILTER==PASS. 

### resolve_sv2_breakpoints.ipynb

Merges stuctural variants that overlap and sets the outermost breakpoints as the new breakpoints.

### merge_nearby.ipynb

Merges structural variants that are very close together with gap length < 20% of total CNV length and less than 50,000 bp.

### intra_cohort_frequency.ipynb

Get's intracohort structural variant count based on 50% reciprocal overlap.

### gnomad_frequency_overall.ipynb

Get's frequency of structural variant in gnomAD release 2.1 cohort.

### gnomad_frequency_control.ipynb

Get's frequency of structural variant in gnomAD release 2.1 cohort (just controls).

### gnomad_frequency_non-neuro.ipynb

Get's frequency of structural variant in gnomAD release 2.1 cohort (just non-neuro).

### annotate_genes.py

Annotates genes.

### combine_all_annotations.ipynb

Combines annotations generated by previous notebooks
